1A. Add fields for Item Acquisition Info

2.A Update verification for Functions.
    * No longer requires everything to be wrapped in parenthesis.
    * Include implied multiply.
    * Include log, ln, and sqrt.

3.A Add verification for Conditions.


4. Maybe graph the function that they made?


5. Refine/refactor this program, its a mess.
Make a validator class which takes an input and validates it.
All Widgets will have a validator when created.

Item Creator Tab will have a list of all widgets.
    When generate item is clicked -> {
        iterate through all widgets in list.
        If Widget is of type JsonSerializable, get ValidationResult from it.

        iterate through all ValidationResults and extract all errorMessages from them.

        if No error messages in all the results proceed to the JSON Conversion Step.

        JSON Conversion step -> {
            Each Widget will have a method that allows it to convert its data into a dictionary.

            iterate through all widgets and call their toJSON function if they are of type JsonSerializable
            update(add) the result to the existing dict.
        }


    }
