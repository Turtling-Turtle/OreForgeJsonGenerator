Overall Goals for Ore Forge Content Manager:

1. Allow the user to create and add items and achievements to the game. Players will also be able to edit content in their game and remove it.

2. An "online" content browser where you can browse other items and achievements/quests that players have created.

3. Syntax highlighting for specific fields.(Boolean Expressions, Functions, Quests etc.)

4. An In Depth Dictionary page about the game and how it functions.

5. Feedback and app analytics?

6. Expression Analyzer that analyzes conditions to determine if they are valid/will function.
